## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.4.0 or later.

## Installation

Install the plugin via the **Plugin Store** or by command line:
```
composer require mutation/translate
php craft install/plugin translations-admin
```

You can now edit your translations in the control panel `/admin/translations-admin`.

## Permissions

You have special permissions for the Translations admin plugin:
- Update translations
- Export translations
- Import translations
- Use utilities
- Change settings

## Settings

You can either go the **settings page** or create a file `translations-admin.php` in your `config` directory.

- **Plugin Name**: How the plugin should be named in the CP
- **Categories**: Choose the source message categories you want to have in your database and control panel.
- **Add missing translations**: Controls whether missing translations are automatically added to the database when a page is visited.
- **Add missing translations for site request only**: Controls whether missing translations are only added when the request is from the site.

Config file example:
```
<?php

return [
    'pluginName' => 'Translations',
    'categories' => [
        ['category' => 'site'],
        ['category' => 'app']
    ],
    'addMissingTranslations' => false,
    'addMissingSiteRequestOnly' => false
];
```

## GraphQL

Query static messages this way:
```
{
  staticMessages(language:["en-CA", "fr-CA"], category: ["site", "app"]) {
    key
    message
    language
    category
  }
}
```

## Events

You can use these custom events in your plugin or module to do any actions after translations are added, saved or deleted (example: empty the cache):
```
use mutation\translate\services\MessagesService;

Event::on(MessagesService::class, MessagesService::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE_MESSAGES, function (Event $e) { ... });
Event::on(MessagesService::class, MessagesService::EVENT_AFTER_ADD_MESSAGE, function (Event $e) { ... });
Event::on(MessagesService::class, MessagesService::EVENT_AFTER_DELETE_MESSAGES, function (Event $e) { ... });
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add mapping for the import and support more format (Excel)
- [ ] Refresh/sync option for the translations overview
- [ ] Allow overriding translations when importing from PHP files
- [X] Add events when adding, saving and deleting translations
